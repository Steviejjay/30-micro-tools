# Cement Bag Calculator

A simple calculator to estimate the number of cement bags needed for construction projects.

## Problem It Solves

Construction workers and project managers need to quickly calculate material requirements. This tool helps avoid under-ordering (project delays) or over-ordering (wasted money).

## How It Works

- **Formula:** 1 cement bag covers 5 square meters at standard thickness (50mm)
- **Input:** Area in square meters
- **Output:** Number of bags needed (rounded up)

## Example

- **Input:** 27 sqm
- **Output:** 6 bags (27 ÷ 5 = 5.4, rounded up to 6)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## What I Learned

- Difference between `class` and `id`
- How `addEventListener()` works
- Using `Math.ceil()` for rounding up
- Form validation in JavaScript
- `return` stops function execution
