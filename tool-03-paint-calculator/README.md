# Paint Coverage Calculator

Calculate the number of paint buckets needed for painting projects.

## Problem It Solves
Helps painters and DIYers estimate paint quantities accurately, accounting for multiple coats.

## How It Works
- **Inputs:** Total area (sqm), coverage per bucket (sqm), number of coats
- **Calculation:** (Area × Coats) ÷ Coverage per bucket
- **Output:** Number of buckets needed (rounded up)

## Example
- **Input:** 30 sqm, 10 sqm/buckets coverage, 2 coats
- **Calculation:** (30 × 2) ÷ 10 = 6 buckets
- **Output:** 6 cans needed

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (blue gradient)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## What I Learned
- Working with 3 inputs
- parseInt() for whole numbers vs parseFloat()
- Multiplication in calculations (area × coats)
- Setting default selected option in dropdown
