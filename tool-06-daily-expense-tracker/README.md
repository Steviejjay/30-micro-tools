# Daily Expense Tracker

Track daily construction project expenses with categories and running totals.

## Problem It Solves

Helps construction managers and contractors monitor daily spending, categorize costs, and stay within budget.

## How It Works

- **Inputs:** Expense name, amount, category
- **Storage:** Expenses stored in array
- **Display:** Shows list of all expenses with total
- **Categories:** Materials, Labor, Equipment, Transport, Other

## Example

- Add: "Cement bags - $150 - Materials"
- Add: "Worker wages - $300 - Labor"
- Total: $450

## Technologies Used

- HTML (text input + number input)
- CSS (expense list styling)
- Vanilla JavaScript (arrays, objects, forEach, DOM manipulation)

## What I Learned

- Text input validation with .trim()
- Creating objects to store data
- Arrays to store multiple items
- .push() to add to arrays
- .forEach() to loop through arrays
- document.createElement() to create elements
- .appendChild() to add elements to DOM
- Dynamically creating HTML
- Running totals with +=
